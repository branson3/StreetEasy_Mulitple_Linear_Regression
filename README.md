# StreetEasy_Mulitple_Linear_Regression

StreetEasy is a tool in New York City to find real estate. I got the dataset off a repository on GitHub. The data sets contain 3,500+ data entries regarding various homes in different areas around Manhattan.

In this notebook we were able to successfully build a linear regression model that took multiple inputs in to consider rent prices in Manhattan.  We were able to get a test score of $R^2 = 0.81$ after training our model on 80% of our data and using 20% to test.
